# MATLAB

This is a Tuning of DC motor using PD controller. The proportional and derivative parameters of the controller are adjusted. The velocity of the dc motor is a feedback to the circuit. So that the motor's rpm is controlled and ended up running at the desired speed. The detailed explanation of the circuit [here](https://saravananannamalai4871.medium.com/pd-tuning-of-a-dc-motor-using-matlab-75c19b037c4d).
